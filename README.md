## Features

While it does require setup from a user, the benefits include:
1. **Quick glances at spending patterns**
2. **Spending by accounts**
3. **Cards associated with an account (in progress)**
4. **Charts which show high-level data about spending**

### How to use this app:
1. Users can sign up via the signup page:  
   [https://fullstack-portfolio-banking-app.onrender.com/signup](https://fullstack-portfolio-banking-app.onrender.com/signup)
2. From there they can store their information and create accounts to get started:
   1. Simply enter the name of the bank and the existing dollar amount.
   2. You can then import transactions and store them in the file *(in progress)*:
      1. For now, users can randomly generate data to see how the functionality works.
3. Users can delete accounts.
4. Users can also edit their transactions. There is full CRUD on transactions—create, remove, update, and delete—from the accounts page.
